# About the Software
The Nand2tetris Software Suite consists of two directories: projects, and tools.

The [**projects**](https://github.com/vovie000/Nand2Tetris/tree/main/Software/projects) directory is divided into 14 project directories named 00, 01, ..., 13 (of which project 00 is relevant only to learners who take the course in Coursera, and project 13 is open-ended). These directories contain files that you have to modify and complete as you work on various nand2tetris projects.

The [**tools**](https://github.com/vovie000/Nand2Tetris/tree/main/Software/tools) directory contains the nand2tetris software tools. It's a collection of programs and files that will be explained as you follow the various projects.

The [**reference**](https://github.com/vovie000/Nand2Tetris/tree/main/Software/reference) directory contains instructions and manuals on various tools.

**The remainder of this section should be used as reference**; there is no need to read what follows until you will be asked to use a particular software tool.

**The .bat and .sh files** are batch and script files, used to invoke the nand2tetris software tools. These files are explained in detail below.

**The bin directory** contains the code of the nand2tetris software tools. It consists of several subdirectories containing Java class files and supporting files.

**The builtInChips and the builtInVMCode directories** contain files that are used by the supplied Hardware Simulator and VM Emulator, respectively.

**The OS directory** contains a compiled version of the Jack operating system.

# Software Tools
## Hardware Simulator
Simulates and tests logic gates and chips implemented in the HDL (Hardware Description Language) described in the book. Used in hardware construction projects.

## CPU Simulator
Emulates the operation of the Hack computer system. Used to test and run programs written in the Hack machine language, in both its binary and assembly versions.

## VM Emulator
Emulates the operation of our virtual machine (similar to Java's JVM); used to run and test programs written in the VM language (similar to Java's Bytcode).

## Assembler
Translates programs from the Hack assembly language to Hack binary code. The resulting code can be executed directly on the Computer chip (in the hardware simulator), or emulated on the supplied CPU Emulator (much faster and more convenient).
