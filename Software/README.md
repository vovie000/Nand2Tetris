# About the Software
The Nand2tetris Software Suite consists of two directories: projects, and tools.

The [**projects**](Software\projects) directory is divided into 14 project directories named 00, 01, ..., 13 (of which project 00 is relevant only to learners who take the course in Coursera, and project 13 is open-ended). These directories contain files that you have to modify and complete as you work on various nand2tetris projects.

The [**tools**](Software\tools) directory contains the nand2tetris software tools. It's a collection of programs and files that will be explained as you follow the various projects.

**The remainder of this section should be used as reference**; there is no need to read what follows until you will be asked to use a particular software tool.

**The .bat and .sh files** are batch and script files, used to invoke the nand2tetris software tools. These files are explained in detail below.

**The bin directory** contains the code of the nand2tetris software tools. It consists of several subdirectories containing Java class files and supporting files.

**The builtInChips and the builtInVMCode directories** contain files that are used by the supplied Hardware Simulator and VM Emulator, respectively.

**The OS directory** contains a compiled version of the Jack operating system.
